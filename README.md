# MedRate

Final project for Web Health Informatics class. This repo contains the entire frontend and dependencies. 

The idea behind MedRate was to allow a means of patients submitted surveys based on their experience at any clinic in the vicinity. They are also given the option to anonymous self-identify, with the goal to allow potentionally margninalized groups to come forward about how they are being treated in clinics.
